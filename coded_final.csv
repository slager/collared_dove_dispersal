After taking a short detour on a side trail to look at the last pines and peek at the ponded area west of the private house, we continued west along the horse trail to the dunes and then found a route through the dunes to an overlook of the creek mouth lagoon.  The lagoon was restricted to a small portion of the normally flooded area with most of it to the southern end of the historic lagoon. We then headed north through the dunes to the dry creek bed and after crossing the creek walked east along the berm on the north side of the creek bed to the horse trail, crossed the dry creek bed again, and continued east along the south berm to where we parked the cars. The total distance covered was 2.05 miles, with only the horse crossing covered twice.

We spent most of the morning around the Salmon Harbor Resort along both Lopez Street on the south and especially Salmon Harbor Road on the north, but also with some time scanning to the west from the south side of a property storage site where Andrew reported seeing a male crossbill, followed by a brief walk through the resort from south to north.  We then drove to Mouth of Smith River Road, and walked a loop west of US 101 from Mouth of Smith River Road over Prince Island Drive and then north along the entire length of South Indian Road to the curve at the north end and then almost back to US 101.  We then spent a bit of time checking crossbill flocks in spruce trees north of Mouth of Smith River Road between US 101 and Ocean View Drive.  After returning briefly to Salmon Harbor Road in the late afternoon to find no crossbills, we returned to the site along Mouth of Smith River Road, which likewise lacked crossbills late in the day, so I walked Ocean View Drive south to Ocean Heights Way before returning along the same route.  Our day consisted of a search for White-winged Crossbills, and directed at a male that had been reported in this area the previous day by Rob Fowler.  Given our single target, we concentrated on Sitka Spruce trees that were heavily laden with ripe cones, but given that these trees were scattered across our route, we found little to concentrate the crossbills, which moved widely over this area with only occasional pauses in the tops of generally rather large spruce trees.  Andrew Howe reported seeing a male White-winged briefly, but it vanished before others could arrive and the rest of us saw identifiably only Red Crossbills.  Other birds on this list were seen mostly incidentally, but I tried to keep at least reasonable track of each species and the respective total.  It was mostly clear to partly cloudy, with a cover that ranged from 5% early to about 30% in the mid-afternoon before clearing somewhat later in our visit.  It was also generally calm, but with a mild (&lt;5 knot) breeze that appeared to be coming from the north.

I did pay moderate attention to the other birds present, yet I failed to see several of the more common species that were calling form the dense vegetation near the creek mouth.  The creek appeared to be lined with leafless willows nearly to the mouth, but there were also stands of willows on the south-facing slopes immediately north of the creek.  There were also two pastures, one small and the other quite large just east of the creek and our position, and the hillsides on our side of the creek were covered with a dense growth of coastal scrub that appeared to include Coyotebrush and a species of Ceanothus with deep blue flowers.  We arrived to an 80% cover of low clouds, yet before we even reached the creek mouth a moderately dense, yet thankfully somewhat broken, fog blew in from the west.  We therefore observed the shrike while waiting for periods of clear sky.  There was a generally mild (initially &lt;5 knots, but later exceeding 5 knots) breeze form the northwest, and temperatures that were probably in the upper 50s.  12:45-3:30 pm.----Pacific Chorus-Frog - 1 (croaking; heard-only).",NA,,NA,seen around the yards near where we parked at the beginning of the road),TRUE52:25.0,1950,species,Eurasian Collared-Dove,Streptopelia decaocto,,,75,,,,United States,US,California,US-CA,Mendocino,US-CA-045,US-CA_46,5,,,"McKinley at Alder, Fort Bragg",L3865199,P,39.442876,-123.794518,8/23/15,7:50:00,obsr86453,S24729622,Traveling,P22,EBIRD,55,2.736,NA,2,1,,0,1,1,,"Dog walk.

We spent the morning scouting the Morro Bay area, where we began by wandering around the lower parts of the golf course at Morro Bay State Park, scanning the adjacent parts of the bay, and then checking the campground (7:20-8:55 am).  Next we checked the mouth of the bay in search of a Red-necked Grebe that had been seen here intermittently, followed by a moderately thorough check of the streets of Morro Bay beginning at the west end of Olive Street but then working up the hillside towards and then around Black Hill before descending the hill along Piney Way.  Along the way we walked quickly through the neighborhoods searching out pockets of better habitat and trying our best to find something unusual.  There were relatively few birds in general, but we did find some interesting species important for the count.  Much of our time was spent wandering around the pine groves on the upper part of Black Hill.  After walking the streets, we again checked the mouth of the bay and again missed the grebe.  We were in and around Morro Bay (including the mouth of the bay) from 9:00 am to 12:45 pm.  After working Morro Bay for an extended period of time, we spent a short time at sites in Los Osos, where we began by scanning the back part of the bay from the Elfin Forest Overlook, then the Audubon Overlook, and finally Sweet Springs.  We also made a brief stop by Sea Pines Golf Course to look at some geese that were frequenting one of the ""water traps.""  In all, we were in Los Osos from 1:00 pm to 3:15 pm.  It was mostly clear to mostly cloudy, with a mild to moderate (generally 10-15+ knot) breeze, seemingly more from the northeast early on but more northwest later, and in the low 50s to upper 60s or possibly the low 70s.  7:15 am - 3:15 pm.----Spotted Munia 1 - (a molting juvenile at Sweet Springs);----Western Gray Squirrel - 4 (Morro Bay State Park).",NA,,NA,(Morro Bay),TRUE30:24.0,1950,species,Eurasian Collared-Dove,Streptopelia decaocto,,,20,,,,United States,US,California,US-CA,San Luis Obispo,US-CA-079,,32,,,Cayucos,L392108,P,35.4431992,-120.8954,4/13/08,8:00:00,obsr7509,S3786229,Traveling,P22,EBIRD,105,4.828,NA,1,1,,0,1,0,,"Time:  0800-0945--Conditons:  Clear, 68-74F, wind up to 19-24 mph offshore--Notes:  I walked from my house to the beach and then to Cayucos Creek Mouth, along Cayucos Ck to Hardie Park, past the school, across Hwy 1, and up the hill to the top of the northern peak, before droping back down along the lower flank of the high southern peak and back down the road to 13th St and along Ocean Ave to 8th St.  I saw 10 Western Pond Turt;es in Cayucos Creek and and an Alligator Lizard on the hillside inland of Hwy 1.",NA,,NA,calling,TRUE11:48.0,1950,species,Eurasian Collared-Dove,Streptopelia decaocto,,,14,,,,United States,US,California,US-CA,San Luis Obispo,US-CA-079,,32,,,Cayucos,L392108,P,35.4431992,-120.8954,4/25/08,8:30:00,obsr7509,S3814911,Traveling,P22,EBIRD,140,4.828,NA,1,1,,0,1,0,,"Time:  0832-1050--Conditions:  clear, 8-12 offshore, 68-72 F--Notes:  I walked from my house to the beach and then to Cayucos Creek Mouth, along Cayucos Ck to Hardie Park, past the school, across Hwy 1, and up the hill to the top of the northern peak, before dropping back down along the willow lined drainage and the lower flank of the high southern peak and back down the road to 13th St and along Ocean Ave to 8th St.  I saw 12 Western Pond Turtles in Cayucos Creek and an about 6 Western Fence Lizards on the hillside inland of Hwy 1.

We were also joined briefly at this site by Maggie Smith and Tom Edell, before Brian and I moved over to check the riparian corridor.  To do so, we drove by the lagoon at the county park and around to Ocean Street and Fountain Avenue on the eastern and northern sides of the Oceano County Airport.  After a quick search of the fence lines and runways of the airport, we parked at the gate on Delta Street and walked over to work the river channel (8:40-10:05 am).  I first worked a short way upstream before entering the riverbed and walking downstream along what was initially a dry bed, but with progressively more water as I continued west until the water was too deep for my boots.  Upon exiting the riverbed, I cut over to the northern dike and then continued most of the way out to the river mouth checking both the willows and the intermittent stands of Sweet Fennel and Coyotebush.  While I did this, Brian checked the pines on the south side of the river and he walked the horse trail out to the dunes before returning and meeting me on the south side.

What seemed to be a breaking, mid-level overcast with a near full cover of clouds was evident upon our arrival, yet the clouds never really cleared during our visit.

We spent our time in and at the edge of the narrow strip of Salicornia bordering the flats concentrating on this one bird, but we did scan the bay, the flats and the small cove to the northeast.  We did not concentrate on the land birds in the eucalyptus trees at the end of Pecho Road or those in the adjacent yards, but we did find a few incidentally.  After our visit to Pecho Road, we spent a short time scanning from the Audubon Overlook off the end of Third Street (11:25-11:45 am), where we checked the birds along the edge of the bay, and those on both the open flats and the water.  We also encountered a few land birds incidentally.  After getting a call about Red Crossbills at Montana de Oro State Park, we cut our visit short.  A mid-level marine layer began to clear about 11:00 am.  It was calm most of the time, but a mild (5 knot) breeze from the west came up around the time the clouds began to clear.

I began near the bridge over which Patterson Avenue crosses lower Atascadero Creek.  I first took a quick detour across the bike bridge to check the lowermost stretch of Maria Ygnacio Creek, after which I returned to Patterson Avenue and then walked north to Ekwill Street, which I checked east to its terminus at Maria Ygnacio Creek.  The highlight here was a row of pink-flowering eucalyptus trees on the north side of a parking lot, where I had most of my Yellow-rumped Warblers and a Selasphorus hummingbird, but nothing truly noteworthy.  I next returned to Patterson Avenue along Ekwill, and I then crossed over to and then across the southern edge of the business park on the west side of the road.  I worked north along the west side of this park, checking the large Myoporum hedge that separates the business park from the agricultural fields.  After checking the parking lots and even a yard on the north side of Hollister Avenue, I worked back south through the middle of the business park.  I next cut over to the agricultural fields, where I walked the perimeter extensively and I even checked many of the internal roads between the fields.  After walking the fields, I exited through a gate to the bike path along Atascadero Creek.  I then worked my way downstream checking the banks of the creek and the vegetation along the path.  I passed the south end of Ward Drive and checked the willow clumps on the north side of the path, but I soon returned to walk a circuit around the Rancho Goleta Mobile Home Park (mostly in search of the geese, ducks, and gulls around the lake).  Upon completing my walk around the mobile home park, I returned to Ward Drive and then the bike path, along which I worked my way back up along Atascadero Creek to Patterson Avenue and even a little beyond to recheck the lowermost 100 meters or so of Maria Ygnacio Creek.  Although it was getting late by this time, I walked out More Ranch Road to the beginning of the trail out towards Goleta Beach along the south side of the creek.  Given that Ron Hirst and Wes Fritz were working along the south side of the creek from the ""gas plant"" to a point opposite Goleta Beach, I checked only the beginning of this trail out to the oak trees immediately north of the plant.  On my way back, I spent a few minutes with a large goldfinch flock that was frequenting the trees near the intersection of More Ranch Road and Patterson Avenue, but by this time, I was already a little late for the mid-day meeting, so I drove straight to Goleta Beach without even stopping for lunch.  It began mostly clear, calm, and in the low 50s, but with high clouds increasing through the morning, and a mild (5-10 knot) breeze from the southwest coming up after about 9:00 am.  Temperatures seemed to increase to the upper 60s by late morning, which made conditions pleasant even if there were not many birds.  7:10 am - 12:20 pm.",NA,,NA,(singing),TRUE34:18.0,1950,species,Eurasian Collared-Dove,Streptopelia decaocto,,,43,,,,United States,US,California,US-CA,Santa Barbara,US-CA-083,,32,,,Santa Maria Bottoms,L505205,H,34.9555332,-120.607996,11/10/10,6:50:00,obsr38892,S7103827,Area,P23,EBIRD,442,NA,1.0117,32,1,,0,1,0,,"Light mist at start, high 50''s, wind 1 to 3 mph.

I twice wandered up along the barranca to the northeast part of the park in search of the Williamson's Sapsucker, which I found on my second attempt (in the same tree where I saw it in November).  For the first time, I also walked along the southern edge of the park, where there were several dense shrubs that looked good for a Worm-eating Warbler (though with the freeway interchange on the other side of the trees it was difficult to hear much in this part of the park).  Although there was a mild breeze, the conditions seemed favorable enough that I thought I had at least a chance of finding the warbler.  There seemed to be many fewer Yellow-rumped Warblers than during my past visits to the park.  It was partly cloudy, with a cover of high, thin clouds.  A generally mild (5-10 knot) breeze was initially coming from the northeast, but it switched to the north or northwest late in my visit.  Temperatures seemed to range from the low 50s to the upper 60s (or maybe even the very low 70s) during my extended visit.  7:25-11:55 am.----Pacific Tree-Frog - 2 (calling; heard-only);--Western Fence Lizard - 2 (I glimpsed a couple of lizards that were probably this species).",NA,,NA,(singing),TRUE29:15.0,1950,species,Eurasian Collared-Dove,Streptopelia decaocto,,,10,,,,United States,US,California,US-CA,Ventura,US-CA-111,US-CA_203,32,,,VC Game Preserve (restricted access),L373996,H,34.1177736,-119.1360855,9/10/10,13:15:00,obsr54638,S6863538,Area,P23,EBIRD,285,NA,150,2,1,,0,1,0,,"I joined Larry Sansone for an afternoon of birding at the hunting club on the Oxnard Plain.

Although we saw both Ruffs and both Solitary and Stilt Sandpipers, we never did find the other bird despite much time searching back-and-forth across all of the ponds that were suitable for shorebirds.  Most of the birds were either in a few ponds in the western part of the club or in one that was in the northeastern part, but there were quite a few ponds with habitat suitable for shorebirds and quite a few birds present.  We spent a short period of time checking the willow clumps and the fence line that separates the club from the naval air station, but in general, we concentrated on the shorebirds and not on land birds.  There were also not too many ducks present.  We looked briefly for a Bobolink that was seen the previous day in a pond with seeding grain located in the middle of the site, but a Peregrine that was chasing the blackbird flock pretty much eliminated our chances of seeing this bird.

What I had seen had led me to believe that I'd seen a Western Kingbird (apparently put too much weight on the black tail that wasn't actually black). Three hours later and over a mile away, I said ""There's the Kingbird!"" before Rob Furrow and I quickly realized that it was a Myiarchus! I was utterly perplexed as to what Myiarchus to expect (no winter records of Great Crested, no Central Valley records of Dusky-capped, almost no winter Cal records of Ash-throat in winter and especially not away from the coast, and almost no pattern of vagrancy for Brown-crested). Rob then pointed out how massive the bill was and it dawned on me that this was likely a BROWN-CRESTED! I took a series of photos before the bird flew off to the north, landed, then continued north out of sight. We were never able to refind it. The total observation time through the scope was about 20ish seconds, maybe a little bit more. ----<br />Submitted from eBird for iOS, version 1.1.3 Build 30",NA,,NA,"Large flocks, mostly around the Marina",TRUE34:26.0,1950,species,Eurasian Collared-Dove,Streptopelia decaocto,,,15,,,,United States,US,California,US-CA,Contra Costa,US-CA-013,,32,,,Holland Tract,L593832,H,37.9751239,-121.58638,1/9/16,9:00:00,obsr188426,S26797943,Traveling,P22,EBIRD,206,6.437,NA,13,1,G1546163,0,1,0,,"Cloudy and extremely windy, with very occasional mist.--Walked north along road past gate from Marina.

Unfortunately, the hummingbird never visited the elderberry trees on the farm property, where others had been able to study it more closely.  Given that this was an organic farm, it was both weedier and more heterogeneous than are most commercial farms, which also made it better for birds.
